Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from reality.

Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.

Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.

Mama, ooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine,
Body's aching all the time.
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.

Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows),
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning very, very frightening me.
(Galileo) Galileo.
(Galileo) Galileo,
Galileo Figaro
Magnifico-o-o-o-o.

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)
Will not let you go. (Let me go!)
Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)
Oh oh oh oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

(Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me.

Any way the wind blows...

[Demoman and Scout run, as Scout trips and falls to the ground] Scout:"WOAH WHAT THE FU-..."[gets hit by four missiles, landing him on the medic's glass wall] "Medic"
["Meet the Medic" text appears]
Heavy: "Wah-hahahaha"
Medic: "Ven the patient voke up, his skeleton is missing, AND THE DOCTOR WAS NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN!!!"
[Medic laughs alone. Half a second later, Heavy laughs with him as he slaps his hand on a tray knocking away the tools on it.]

Heavy: "What was noise?"
Medic: "The sound of progress my friend."
[Medic goes to his fridge.]
Medic: "Ja, Perfect!"
[Medic takes a mega baboon heart revealing a blue spy's head being connected to a potato and electrical meter.]
Blue Spy: "Kill Me."
Medic: "Later."
[Closes fridge.]
Medic: "Where was i?, There we go..." [Sticks heart onto a voltage meter. Places it to where the Medigun is pointing and the heart beats faster.]
[The violin/string instrument in background gets faster in sync with the heart.]
Medic: "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHA"
Heavy: "Ha.. ha.."[Looks worried]
Medic: "HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHA"
[A flash of light explodes revealing the screen.]
(The big heart is ubercharged, as it glows red with red-orange glows that look like sillhouette cracks flowing.)
Medic: "oooh that looks good. zhere"
[Plops heart in Heavy's cavity.]
Heavy: "Should I be awake for this?"
Medic: "Heh, no. But, as long as you are could you open your ribcage for me? I can't seem to-"
[As Medic tries to open up Heavy's ribcage, they hear a loud crack and Heavy screams and reveals a rib in his hand.]
Heavy: "AHH!"
Medic: "Aw, don't be such a baby, ribs grow back."
[Medic takes the rib and throws it away. Turns around and talks to Archimedes or a dove.]
Medic: "No zey don't."
[Medic takes the mounted Medigun and brings it closer to Heavy. His organs and such all regenerate including his shirt and vest.]
Heavy: [Inhales then exhales] "What now Doctor?"
Medic: "Now?"[Chuckles while lifting Heavy up by the hands] "Let's go pwatice medicine."
[As Medic dresses up and equips his tools, a drum plays in the background. He comes out of a door with shining light behind him and doves flying out.]
[As Medic comes out, Heavy runs forward and Demoman rushes towards Medic in a wheelchair and wrapped in bandages.]
Demoman: "MEDIC!"
[Demoman gets hit with a rocket sending him flying and landing near Medic. Medic pushes his glasses up and flips some switches on the Medigun, then aims it at Demoman healing him. Demoman gets up whilst removing his cast and bandages. He then quickly nods at Medic and heads back towards battle. Medic sees another wounded person and aims his gun at him. Scout appears in the screen smiling and grows back a missing tooth.]
Scout: "OH YEAH!"
[Scout springs back up grabbing his baseball bat and runs. He hits a soldier with it around a corner.]
[Heavy is hiding behind a rock with and an army of soldiers advancing towards him.]
Heavy: “Doctor!” “Are you sure this will work!?”
Medic: “Haha!” “I have no idea!”
[Medic flips a switch, activating the Ubercharge.]
[Heavy jumps out from behind a rock, and starts up his minigun.]
[Ubercharge starts.]
Heavy: “Yah! HAHA”
[Heavy and Medic start walking up to the army of soldiers, Heavy still laughing]
[Engineer and Sniper look over at Heavy and Medic]
Heavy:”HAHAHA, I am bulletproof!”
[Heavy and Medic stand atop a pile of deseased soldiers, as the music crescendos]
[Team Fortress 2 closing music plays]
[All the Mercenaries are waiting outside Medic’s office]
[Engie playing guitar]
Medic, Off-Screen:”That looks good, Very nice there.”
Scout, Off-screen:”Hey, thanks Doc!”
[Scout busts open the doors to the waiting room, all the mercs look over to him]
Scout:”Aw man! You would not believe...how much this hurts.”
[Archimedes coos from inside Scouts chest.]
Medic: Archimedes?



Jojo's Bizarre Adventure OP 2: Bloody Stream

静寂(しじま)の底から 目覚めるその柱たち 時を越え
深紅の血潮が 立ち上がる勇気を 惹きあわせる

受け継ぐ愛を 宿命(さだめ)と呼ぶなら
微笑む目で 次の手を

闇を欺いて 刹那を躱(かわ)して
刃すり抜け奴らの間隙(すき)を突け
つらぬいた信念(おもい)が 未来を拓く
Like a Bloody Storm 熱くLike a Bloody Stone
血脈に刻まれた因縁に
浮き上がる消えない誇りの絆 握りしめて


漲る力に 打ち付ける鼓動は証 友の声
滲んだ痛みと 今生き抜く意味を 交わしながら

お前の意志が 夜明けを導く
目映いほどの 気高さで

光射す丘へ 灼熱の空へ
魂がぶつかりあう旅路へ
悲しみに塗られた 未来を救え
Like a Bloody Soul 燃やせLike a Bloody Star
炎裂き風を断ちその先へ
怖れずに何も躊躇わず進め 流れの中

共鳴する 運命の波紋 胸(こころ)に

闇を欺いて 刹那を躱(かわ)して
刃すり抜け奴らの間隙(すき)を突け
つらぬいた信念(おもい)が 未来を拓く
Like a Bloody Storm 熱くLike a Bloody Stone
血脈に刻まれた因縁に
浮き上がる消えない誇りの絆 握りしめて
